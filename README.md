# Letsema - Distributed Microfinance System

## Introduction

Letsema is a distributed microfinance management system designed to help Microfinance Institutions (MFIs) efficiently manage loans, users, and financial operations. The system supports three primary roles with distinct functionalities:
- **Borrowers**: Self-register, apply for loans, view loans, make repayments
- **MFI Admins**: Approve/reject loans, manage repayments, view MFI users
- **Letsema Admins**: Register new MFIs, manage all users and system-wide operations

## System Architecture

### Database Design
- **PostgreSQL**: Primary relational database with multi-tenancy (schema-per-tenant)
- **MongoDB**: Stores non-relational borrower credit histories
- **Distributed Architecture**: Master-Master replication across PostgreSQL nodes

### Core Tables
| Table           | Key Fields                          |
|-----------------|-------------------------------------|
| Loan            | loan_id, user_id, mfi_id, amount    |
| User            | user_id, role, personal details    |
| MFI             | mfi_id, name, location, contact    |
| Loan Repayment  | repayment_id, loan_id, amount_paid |

## Key Features

### Role-Based Functionalities

- Automated tenant provisioning via API
- Distributed PostgreSQL with master-master replication
- Django-based backend with React frontend
